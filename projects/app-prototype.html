	  <p class="short-bio">Orientation is a resource made available specifically for transfer students that would essentially catch them up with all the things first-years learned during their time at the new school. It would also help the general student population with confusion over having multiple apps and websites to use during enrollment by linking or combining all those into Orientation. This would help relieve transfer students, including myself, and thus it’d be a huge solution to most of my problems attending any university. This would include resources for Financial aid, registration, and housing dates for First-year transfer students. As well as events open to older transfer students to get accustomed to the community, contact information for staff that specializes in the transfer process, FAQs, 9 to 5 live messaging, and anything else that a transfer student would’ve missed out on during a normal first-year enrollment.  </p>
