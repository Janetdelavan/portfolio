        <P>I see the mind as an emergent property, and the very important and interesting consequence of this emergent property is our own sense of self. My sense of self exists because it gives me an interface with the world. I'm “me” for interactions, but my “I” doesn't substantially exist, in the sense that it can't be localized anywhere.</P>

<P>Fauvism is an art movement and style that was established towards the beginning of the 20th century. Pioneered by the likes of Henri Matisse and André Derain, in its early years Fauvism was predominantly affiliated with French artists. Fauvist art is characterised by its bold colours, textured brushwork and non-naturalistic depictions.</P>
<p class="pull-quote">“In some ways, Fauvist artists emerged as an extension of the Impressionist artists working at the turn of the century.”</p>
<p>Linked by the way they painted directly from nature, Fauvists are sometimes associated with post-Impressionism. However, unlike the Impressionists, the Fauvists paid particular attention to capturing emotion in their subjects. Often painting portraits, landscapes and nudes, the Fauvists enhanced the colours and tones of the natural world, whilst closely observing scientific colour theories that had been developed in the previous century. Fauvism combines so many of the art movements that proceeded it, borrowing everything from German Expressionism to neo-Impressionism.</p>
<p>he term ‘Fauvism’ translates to mean ‘wild-beasts’ and was coined by critic Louis Vauxcelles following the 1905 Salon d’Autumne exhibition. The exhibition, which was held in Paris, caused widespread outrage. Such vibrant and unnatural colours shocked the public and critics alike, as Fauvism soon earned its place as one of the first avant-garde art movements of the 20th century.</p>
<p>The figure most commonly associated with Fauvism is none other than Matisse. Taking influence from Gauguin, van Gogh and Seurat, Matisse moved art that one step closer to abstraction. This groundbreaking modernist movement did away with the stillness of the subject matter, instead instilling colour with movement and brushwork with energy.</p>
