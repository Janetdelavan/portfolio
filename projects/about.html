	  <p class="short-bio">I'm Janet Delavan, a self-taught illustrator and communication design undergrad at Parsons School of Design in NYC. With a passion for learning new things, and discovering new interests, my style is constantly evolving. My illustrations focus on joyful compositions and warm color palettes to make life a little brighter. I believe in approaching every project with mindfulness and determination to make each creation better than the last. When I'm not designing, I spend my free time playing tennis, getting late-night coffee, and spending time with her friends! See what I've been working on below! </p>
